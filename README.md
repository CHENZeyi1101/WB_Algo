# Abstract 

We propose a provably convergent algorithm for approximating the 2-Wasserstein barycenter of continuous non-parametric probability measures. Our algorithm is inspired by the fixed-point iterative scheme of Álvarez-Esteban et al. (2016), whose convergence to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter relies on obtaining exact optimal transport (OT) maps.

However, OT maps are typically only approximately computed in practice, and exact computation of OT maps between continuous probability measures is only tractable for certain restrictive parametric families. To circumvent the need to compute exact OT maps between general non-parametric measures, we develop a tailored iterative scheme that utilizes consistent estimators of the OT maps instead of the exact OT maps.

This gives rise to a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm which is provably convergent to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter. Our algorithm remarkably does not restrict the support of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter to be any fixed finite set and can be implemented in a distributed computing environment, which makes it suitable for large-scale data aggregation problems.

In our numerical experiments, we propose a method of generating non-trivial instances of 2-Wasserstein barycenter problems where the ground-truth barycenter measure is known. The results showcase the capability of our algorithm in developing high-quality approximations of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods based on generative neural networks in terms of accuracy, stability and efficiency.

# Main Contributions

1. **Stochastic Fixed-Point Algorithm**  
   We provide a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm (i.e., *Algorithm 2*) for approximately computing the W₂-barycenter of general input measures ν₁, ..., ν_K.  
   Our iterative algorithm is characterized by a tailored truncating operation and an "admissible" class of optimal transport (OT) map estimators (see *Assumption 3.4*).  
   In particular, we do not restrict the support of the approximate W₂-barycenter to a finite collection of points, nor do we require ν₁, ..., ν_K to be discrete or to follow specific parametric families. Only mild regularity conditions are needed (see *Assumption 3.1* and *Setting 3.6*).

2. **Theoretical Convergence Guarantee**  
   We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis to show that our algorithm converges to the true W₂-barycenter of ν₁, ..., ν_K in an almost sure sense (see *Setting 3.13* and *Theorem 3.14*).  
   Specifically, we adapt the computationally efficient entropic OT map estimator by Pooladian and Niles-Weed [52], incorporating tailored modifications to ensure convergence (see *Corollary 4.3*).  
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computationally tractable extension of the fixed-point iterative scheme by Álvarez-Esteban et al. [3] with a convergence guarantee.

3. **Synthetic Benchmark Generation**  
   We propose a simple and efficient method to generate synthetic instances of the W₂-barycenter problem, where the input measures are continuous and non-parametric, and the true barycenter is known (see *Proposition 5.2*).  
   These instances allow benchmarking and evaluating the effectiveness of W₂-barycenter algorithms.  
   Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is empirically accurate, efficient, and stable compared with state-of-the-art alternatives, and supports parallel/distributed computing — making it well suited for large-scale applications.
